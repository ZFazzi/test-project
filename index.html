        This lesson I've learned some basics, some things I knew from before and some are new to me. 
    </p>

    <h3>
        These are some things I've learned about HTML
    </h3>

            - How you can create different paragraphs, tags and attributes
            <br>
            - How structure makes code easier to read
            <br>
            - W3 has great HTML/CSS/Javascript material
            <br>
            - The fact that its so much easier to write code today than it was 10 years ago when I first tried coding, so I'm very excited to give this a new try!

    <h3>These are some things I've learned about Git and Github</h3>
        <ol>
            - Git Bash is where your work is localy stored. 
            <br>
            - You can push work you've done to GitHub where your teamates can access the code I've edited in a branch outside the master code.
            <br>
            - You can also pull the most updated version of the master, dont forget to do this before you push your code.
           <br>
            - In Git you can also create branches and choose which branch to make requests to.
            <br>
            - When you push a branch, i.e post it to Github, its a sort of draft that needs to get reviewed by the team manager before being merged into the master code.
            <br>
            - When a branch is merged it is submitted into the master code and no longer a draft.
            <br>
            - Multiple branches can be created to the master code at the same time, it can be compared to a tree, where all the branches come from the same roots.
        </ol>
