    <h3>What I've learned</h3>
    <p>This lesson I've learned some basics, some things I knew from before and some are new to me.
        This is what I've learned:
        <ol> <!--Skapar en osorterad lista, förstår inte riktigt hur den fungerar än men jag la till "-" för att få till listformatet-->
            - How to create a folder
            <br>
            - How you can create different paragraphs, tags and attributes
            <br>
            - How structure makes code easier to read
            <br>
            - W3 has great HTML/CSS/Javascript material
            <br>
            - The fact that its so much easier to write code today than it was 10 years ago when I first tried coding, so I'm very excited to give this a new try!
            <br>
            - Git and Github is pretty complicated, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it eventually.
            <br>
            - Also, I feel sorry for the people who are doing this on only one screen, I tried and it's much more difficult, I'm glad I have two :)
